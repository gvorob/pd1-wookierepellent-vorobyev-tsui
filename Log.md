6/03	Derek	MyPoint has mass, velocity, gravity
6/03	George	MyPoint has a static list of all points and a static method to get nearby points
6/04	Derek	Neighbors automatically link to another upon creation
6/04	George	Link class for springs between points
6/05	George  Fixed gravity and velocity scaling, so is 1/sec, not 1/tick
6/06	Derek	MyPoint calculates net forces (INCOMPLETE)
6/08	George 	fixed forces, accelerations/velocity are now all changed at once, THEN all the positions are updated
6/09	Derek	Fixed points with SHIFT
6/09 	George 	Fixed points with SHIFT
6/11	Derek	Ooze class, remove links
6/11 	George 	Debug GUI shenanigans
6/12	Derek	Github branches - mess
6/12 	George	Github branches - mess
6/13	Derek	Link fixing
6/13	George	Github branches
6/15 	Derek   More ui things
6/15	George	Oooze works properly now, sorta, still needs viscosity and constants tweaking
6/17	Derek	Gravity on/off feature
Project extension
6/18	Derek	Side walls fix, color differentiation schemes
6/18	George	new mode for points (Node), toggle between point types

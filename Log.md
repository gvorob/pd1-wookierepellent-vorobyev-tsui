6/03	Derek	MyPoint has mass, velocity, gravity
6/03	George	MyPoint has a static list of all points and a static method to get nearby points
6/04	Derek	Neighbors automatically link to another upon creation
6/04	George	Link class for springs between points
6/05	George  Fixed gravity and velocity scaling, so is 1/sec, not 1/tick
6/06	Derek	MyPoint calculates net forces (INCOMPLETE)
6/08	George 	fixed forces, accelerations/velocity are now all changed at once, THEN all the positions are updated
6/09	Derek	Fixed points with SHIFT
6/09 	George 	Fixed points with SHIFT
6/11	Derek	Ooze class, remove links
6/11 	George 	Debug GUI shenanigans
